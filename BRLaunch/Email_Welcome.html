            Thanks for signing up as a Brewrocket Test Pilot - we’re excited to have you on board.
             We wanted to let you know that your account has been activated, and we are processing your homebrew kit order (please allow up to 10 business days). 
            However, we do encourage you to start taking a look at our platform beforehand!
            <br />
            <br />
            The course you will be working through is ‘Brewing 101’ – the first part of our planned curricula.
             Our goal is to build the ultimate online educational platform for homebrewing, and we think the best way to achieve this is
             by listening to our user’s thoughts on the platform, and implementing them the best way we can. 
            That being said – as you follow along in the course, we ask that you provide us with as much feedback as possible. 
            We want to hear anything and everything from ideas for features, bugs found, etc.
            <br />
            <br />
            To show our thanks, all of our test users will have free access to all new content when we release our final version of the platform – forever. This means that every course we release, you get to enroll absolutely free.
            Also, keep an eye out for an email from us within the next few days.
             We’ll be sending you an invitation to our private member community via <a href=”http://www.slack.com”>Slack!</a> 
            Here you’ll be able to talk with other members, get help from our staff, and more.
            <br />
            <br />
            Again, we thank you for joining and testing out the future of homebrewing education.
            <br />
            <br />
            Thanks,
            <br />
            Christian & Sean
