            First, we’d like to say thank you for stopping by our booth last Saturday at the National Beer Expo.
            We had a blast talking to everyone about our company! 
            We’ve got big plans for Brewrocket, and want you to be a part of our journey. If you havn't already, we encourage you
            to sign up for a FREE account <a href="http://www.brewrocket.io">here.</a> We are looking for as much feedback and support as
            possible so we can make Brewrocket the best homebrewing educational platform.
            <br />
            <br />
            Secondly, we’d like to congratulate you on being selected as one of our winners of the $25 gift certificate to Original Gravity in Richmond, VA! 
            You can pick up your certificate by visiting Original Gravity at 6118 Lakeside Ave, Henrico, VA 23228, they’ll have it waiting for you behind the counter starting this Friday.
             All you’ll need to do is varify your email address we sent this to with them.
