                        <b>What is malt extract brewing?</b>
                        <br />
                        Brewing with malt extract is by far the easiest way to get started making beer –
                        in fact the majority of home brewers started this way. Malt extract is the product of mashing barley that has been
                        partially germinated, dried out, and roasted – then steeped to extract the natural sugars. The liquid from the steep is
                        then reduced until it consists of thick syrup, which is the primary ingredient we use to make the sweet liquid called wort.
                        <br />

                        The basic process consists of just boiling the malt, water, and hops together.
                        Hops are added to the wort (the term for the sweet liquid before it becomes beer) at
                        various stages of the boil to add bitterness, flavor and aroma. Finally, the last step will
                        be to pitch your yeast into the cooled wort, and let the magic happen! Pretty straight forward right?
                        <br />

                        <b>What equipment do I need?</b>
                        <br />
                        Aside from the pot you’ll need to boil the wort, you’re starter kit includes everything you need to
                        brew your first batch of beer: a 2 gallon fermentation bucket, 1 airlock, a thermometer, hydrometer,
                        test tube, auto siphon, sanitizer, priming sugar, 2 64oz plastic growlers, and your first recipe kit.
                        As your brewing knowledge grows, most likely so will your brewing setup.
                        Since we are just starting out with extract brewing; only minimal equipment is needed.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        In the video below, we met up with Tony Ammendolia, owner of Original Gravity Homebrew supply in Richmond, VA who walked us through the various brewing equipment needed. Once you finish watching, we recommend opening up your supply kit (If you haven’t already) and become familiar with the different items, and how they are used. Keep in mind, if you have any detailed questions about your equipment, use our knowledge-base to find the answer, or use the slack community boards to post your question.

                        <b>Be a Clean Freak.</b>
                        <br />
                        If we could give you only one piece of advice when it comes to brewing, it would definitely have to be keeping your equipment, and work area sanitary. Plus, who likes a sticky, dirty work area?

                        The worst enemy of beer also happens to be the most common issue a new home brewer runs into – contamination.
                        Did you know the standard for commercial brewery cleanliness is close to that of an operating room?
                        
                        Anything that comes in contact with your wort once the boil is finished needs be both washed and sanitized.
                        Items used prior to boiling should be washed, but sanitization is not necessary - the boil will take care of this.
                        <br />
                        <b>Wash vs Sanitize</b><br />
                        Washing is simply the act of removing dust, dirt and grime from your equipment.
                        Sanitizing your equipment is a separate step to kill off remaining bacteria and micro-organisms that might linger after washing.
                        A thorough washing is a precursor to sanitizing, as sanitizing agents alone will not be able to remove built up grime and deposits on
                        equipment that harbor bacteria.  Remember, NEVER use dish detergent or soap with any of your brewing equipment not even your spoons, doing so may hinder the taste of your beer.
                        <br />
                        <b>Cleaning Products</b><br />
                        There is an array of products you can use to help fight the attack of bad microorganisms on your beer.
                        Here at Brewrocket HQ, we primarily use Star-San for sanitation and PBW for deep cleaning; They have never led us astray.
                        You can find detailed specs on Star-San <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fivestarchemicals.com/wp-content/uploads/Star-San-HB4.pdf">here</a>, and PBW <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fivestarchemicals.com/wp-content/uploads/PBWTech.pdf">here.</a>
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        In the video below, we meet with Mike Killelea, head brew master at Center of the Universe Brewing Co. in Ashland, Virginia who went over sanitary importance and some of the cleaning products available today.

                        <br />
                        Aside from the sanitization aspect of brewing, you should also note that staying organized is almost just as important.
                        Like a pilot inspects their plane before flight, you should go through a check list before you start brewing.
                        You will want to know that all of your equipment is clean, and in working order, as well as making sure you have all the
                        ingredients needed for your recipe.
                        It’s never a fun day when you are about to pitch your yeast, and realize you forgot to pick it up! <br />
                        So, in efforts to help you avoid those “uh-oh” moments we’ve started a brew day check list for you, as well
                        as met with Mike Killelea again to talk about his brew day process.

                        <b>Water Plays an Important Role</b>
                        <br />
                        Being that water makes up around 97% of the beer you drink, it's safe to say that it plays an important role. That's why many breweries will get water samples from cities where the beer they are creating originated. For example, the water in Pilz, Czech is much different than here in the United States, therefore a pilsner made with water here will taste different than one in its birthplace. Average Joes might not taste it, but the judges will. It is amazing how much water can impact your beer.

                        The varying mineral levels in water have an impact on the flavor, perceived bitterness, and hop utilization of finished beer.

                        To help you better understand, we met with Tony Ammendolia, owner of Original Gravity Homebrew Supply and Final Gravity Nanobrewery, as well
                        as Brian Nelson, head brew master of Hardywood Park Craft Brewery. In the videos, you'll learn about the importance of water in brewing, as well
                        as understanding PH and what it means for your beer.

                        It all starts with the brew day, followed by primary fermentation, secondary fermentation, and finished by bottling.
                        <br />
                        <b>Part 1: The Brew Day</b>
                        <br />

                        Beer starts its life as grain, water, hops, and yeast –
                        and it’s all up to you to transform them into the sugar liquid, that will eventually become drinkable (in about 4 – 6 weeks). During your brew days, expect to spend anywhere between 3 ½ to 4 hours (so plan your schedule accordingly) to complete all of the steps. For an extract brew, the steps you would take are as follows:



                        <ul style="font-size:large;color:#2a2727;line-height:40px">
                            <li>
                                Water is added to the kettle and heated
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Optionally, you can steep whole grains at this point for color, flavor, and body.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Liquid, or dry malt extract is added to the water to form the sweet wort.</li>
                            <li>Hops are added, and the wort is boiled for 60- 90 minutes.</li>
                            <li>Cold water is added to bring up the volume, and the wort is cooled to room temperature as quickly as possible.</li>
                            <li>Wort is transferred to the primary fermenter, and the yeast is pitched. Typically you will notice activity within 24- 48 hours.</li>

                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p style="color:#2a2727;font-size:large;line-height:40px">
                        <b>Part 2: Primary Fermentation</b>
                        <br />
                        Primary fermentation is the magical process where the yeast starts to eat the sugars in the wort and convert it to alcohol.
                        One of the benefits of using a glass carboy for fermentation versus a plastic bucket is the fact that you’ll be able to a
                        peak in on all the action and see all of the yeast partying it up! At this point, you can rest and let the yeast do their job
                        for about a week or so.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <b>Part 3: Secondary Fermentation</b>
                        <br />
                        Once the yeast has started to settle down, you then can transfer the beer into the secondary fermenter.
                        Things are going to be much quieter during this stage, and you won’t notice much activity, if any at all.
                        Again, if you decide to use a glass carboy, you will only notice the yeast sediment layer at the very bottom of the container,
                        and the un-carbonated beer resting on top. You’ll want to let it sit in this stage for about two weeks to ensure the yeast have eaten
                        all the sugars.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <b>Part 4: Bottling</b>
                        <br />
                        Man, you’re so close to being able to pop one open! Well maybe…
                        You’ll want to condition in the bottle for a minimum of two weeks,
                        but in our experience the longer you wait the better the flavor. Homebrew beer is usually good up to a year,
                        so, although tough to wait, it is well worth it!
                        <br />

                        Finally, the time has come to brew. We’re happy you’ve made it this far, and didn’t just keep ‘Make my own beer’ on your bucket-list forever.
                        <br />

                        <b>So, first things first –</b><br />
                        You'll want to go over you’re brew day checklist from Lesson 3, and make sure you have everything…Check it twice!
                        <br />
                        <b>Next, you’re going to want to set up your sanitation bucket.</b> <br />
                        Follow the instructions on the sanitation product you have chosen. Once you have your sani-bucket filled, you can set it to the side for now.
                        We usually will throw equipment in there to get it out of the way too like our hydrometer, test tube, funnels, etc.
                        <br />
                        <b>Fill her up!</b>
                        <br />
                        Now let’s fill up your brew kettle up with water to the amount specified in your recipe
                        (making sure not to fill it completely to the top). Since we are doing an extract brew, you won’t have to worry about
                        calculating grain absorption – just add a little extra water to make up for the evaporation during the boil.
                        A good rule of thumb – 1.5 gallons of water gets boiled off every hour.
                        If you are not adding steeping grains, sit tight and let the water come to a gentle boil.
                        <br />
                        <b>However, if you choose to steep grains...</b><br />
                        Then you’ll want to add them once the water has reached 150-170F in temperature.
                        Steeping grains adds fermentable sugars to your brew, as well as providing a variety of flavors and colors.
                        To steep, generally you will want to put the grains in a sleeping bag, and then immerse the bag into the water.
                        Keep in mind, once you reach the 150-170F mark, turn down your burner as you will want to steep your grains at this temperature
                        for about 30 minutes.

                        Once you are done with the steeping, it’s time to add the malt extract to your kettle.
                        <br />
                        <b>Adding the Malt Extract</b> <br />
                        Open the can or tub of extract and pour it into the kettle, slowly stirring the wort with the other hand to prevent
                        the extract from sitting (trust us, the burn marks do not come off your kettle easily!)
                        Once you've completly added all of the extract, turn up your burner and let it come back to a rolling boil.
                        Let your wort boil for the amount of time specified in your recipe, occasionaly stirring as you wait.
                        <br />
                        <b>Add the Recipies Adjuncts</b>
                        <br />
                        This is also where you are going to add your first addition of hops, if your recipe calls for it.
                        The first addition of hops will add the bitterness profile to your brew.
                        For a little more detail on hops, check out our interview with Josh and Aaron of Isley Brewing Co, and for a more in depth look on the boil watch our interview with Kenny Allen of Old Ox Brewery.

                        Let the wort continue to boil, occasionally stirring and adding any additional adjuncts your recipe calls for until the 60 or 90 minute mark has been reached.
                        <br />
                        <b> As you approach the boil, make sure you have your ice bath set up and ready to go.</b>
                        <br />
                        The wort is in a very dangerous stage, and is prone to infection.
                        Do whatever you can to keep any thing from falling into your wort (hair, dust, etc.)
                        so you will want to cool it down to around 70F (unless your recipe says otherwise) and pitch the yeast as quickly as possible,
                        making sure anything that comes in contact with your wort is sanitized.
                        An easy way to make your ice bath is to fill your sink up with cold water with ice, and set the covered kettle inside.
                        Never ever, ever…add ice cubes to the wort to cool it down.
                        <br />

                        <b>Transfer to the Fermenter</b>
                        <br />
                        Once the entire volume of wort has reached room temperature (make sure you measure at different depths and areas),
                        transfer the wort to your sanitized primary fermenter adding additional room temperature water first to make up the difference
                        you lost during the boil. It is important to make sure the wort is the same temperature as the yeast;
                        any hotter or colder could damage the yeast cells. To transfer, slowly pour the wort through a funnel into the fermenter.
                        BREW TIP** If your kettle has a spiggot, we recommend placing it on your counter, with your fermentor below, letting gravity do
                        work!
                        You may need to stop occasionally and clean out the funnel filter, as broken up hops may start to clog it.
                        <br />
                        <b>Take an Original Gravity Reading</b>
                        <br />
                        Once you have gotten all of the wort transferred, take your sanitized test tube and fill it up with the wort about 80% to the top.
                        Set it on a flat surface, and use your hydrometer to take an original gravity reading.
                        Record this number, as you will need to calculate ABV later on.
                        To learn more in detail about gravity, check out our video interview with Mike Killelea.

                        <br />
                        Lastly, we will need to pitch your yeast. Open up your slap pack, or liquid yeast starter and carefully pour it into the fermenter.
                        Once all in, place your airlock on the fermenter, and give it a few good shakes. This is to aerate the wort, and help get the yeast active.

                        Aside from the cleanup, you’re part for now is done.
                        For the next week, the yeast you just pitched is going to be working like crazy eating up all the sugars.
                        In the next lesson, we’ll talk to you a little more in depth about what’s really happening during this process.

                        <b>Primary Fermentation</b>
                        <br />
                        It’s time to let the yeast go to work. Soon after (anywhere from 6-48 hours) you pitch the yeast,
                        you’ll start to notice some activity. The airlock will start to bubble, and foam called <b>Krausen</b> will form on top of the beer.
                        The Krausen consists of yeast and wort proteins and is a light creamy color. If you are seeing these signs, wipe off the sweat
                        from your forehead – you’ve done it right so far.
                        <br />
                        <b> Secondary Fermentation</b>
                        <br />
                        <span style="font-style:italic">   **This is an optional step, typically done if brewing a heavily hopped or fruit beer.</span>
                     
                        <br />
                        Eventually (about a week or so) the yeast will start to settle down,
                        and the Krausen will collapse. When this happens, you will know it’s time to transfer the beer
                        into the secondary fermenter. When you do the transfer (By using an auto- siphon), try to leave
                        as much of the sediment on the bottom as you can – so be gentle and try not to shake up the fermenter much.
                        Once transferred into the secondary (You set this up the same as you did with your primary), you’re beer will
                        start a mini-fermentation and the yeast will finish up their life cycle. Let your beer sit for about 2 weeks in the secondary.
                        Once you’ve notice zero activity, take a gravity reading and record it. Take another reading within the next day or so –
                        and compare it to the first. If you notice a change, let it sit for a few days and repeat the testing process.
                        If nothing has changed, you’re ready to bottle.

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Create your sanitization solution per the instructions on the product.</li>
                                    <li>Soak all of your bottling equipment in the solution for at least 15 – 30 minutes.</li>
                                    <li>Make sure your bottles are cleaned before you sanitize.</li>
                                </ul>

                                    <li>The process of priming is simply adding sugar to the beer. Priming helps carbonate your brew, by giving the yeast just a little bit extra food while it’s in the bottle. You will want to use corn sugar for this (not cane!)</li>
                                    <li>To make the priming sugar solution, as a general rule of thumb, use 1 oz of priming sugar per every gallon of beer. Add a few cups of water (2-3) to a sauce pan with the priming sugar, and bring to a boil (occasionally stirring to help the sugar dissolve).</li>
                                    <li>Cover the solution, and let cool</li>
                                </ul>

                                Add solution and beer to the bottling bucket
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Once the solution has cooled to around room temperature, add it to your bottling bucket.</li>

                                Next, you’ll want to use the auto-siphon and rack your beer to the bottling bucket.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Move the bottling bucket to a higher level</li>
                                    <li>You’re going to want to utilize gravity here to help make the beer flow.</li>
                                    <li>Attach the tubing to the end of the bottling bucket spigot, and then attach the filler wand to the other end of the tubing. Open the spigot.</li>

                                        To calculate ABV use this formula by plugging in your OG reading and Final Gravity (FG) reading:
                                        ABV = (1.05/0.79) X ((OG – FG) / FG) x 100
                                        **Where 1.05 is the number of grams of ethanol produced for every gram of CO2 produced, and .79 is the density of ethanol
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Cap the bottles
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Depending on the type of capper you are using instructions will vary. If you are using the common hand-capper, rest a cap on the bottle so it sits evenly. Bring the handles of the capper together so the jaws meet around the neck of the bottle. Push the handles apart until the cap seats. Release and the cap will attach.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Store and Age
                                <ul>
                                    <li>	When storing your beer, it’s best to do so in a cool dark place inside of a cardboard box.</li>
                                    <li>At a minimum, let your beer sit for 2 weeks – although we recommend waiting it out for 6 for typically much better results.</li>
                                </ul>
